## Introduction

<a name="introduction"></a>

The ESP Azure IoT SDK is based on [Azure IoT C SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c) and enables users to connect their ESP32 based devices to the Azure IoT hub. It provides some examples which can help understand most common use cases.

## Getting Started

<a name="get-started"></a>

### Hardware

You will basically just need a development host and an [ESP32 development board](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/hardware/development-boards) to get started.

### Development Host Setup

This project is to be used with Espressif's IoT Development Framework, [ESP IDF](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf). Follow these steps to get started:

- Setup ESP IDF development environment by following the steps [here](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/get-started/index.html).
- In a separate folder, clone the esp-azure project as follows (please note the --recursive option, which is required to clone the various git submodules required by esp-azure)

``` bash
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/espressif/esp-azure.git
```

> Note that if you ever change the branch or the git head of either esp-idf or esp-azure, ensure that all the submodules of the git repo are in sync by executing `git submodule update --init --recursive`

### Setting up Azure IoT Hub

- Create an Azure IoT Hub by following the documentation [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-create-through-portal).

> **Note: When selecting the "Pricing and scale tier", there is also an option to select , F1: Free tier, which should be sufficient for basic evaluation.**

- Copy the IoT Hub `Connection string - primary key` from the Azure IoT Hub. This will be required later. The screenshot below will help you locate it.

- Connection string - primary key sample:

```
HostName=<azure-iot-hub-name>.azure-devices.net;SharedAccessKeyName=iothubowner;SharedAccessKey=<base64-encoded-access-key>
```

### Setting up Azure CLI

- Install [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest)
- From your terminal, execute the `az` command to verify that the installation was successful. Output will be like this:

```
$ az

Welcome to Azure CLI!
---------------------
Use `az -h` to see available commands or go to https://aka.ms/cli.
...
```

- Install the Azure IoT CLI extension using

`$ az extension add --name azure-cli-iot-ext`

After that, you should be able to use azure CLI to manage your iot-device. A list of useful Azure CLIs can be found [here](doc/azure_cli_iot_hub.md) 

## Creating an Azure IoT Device

<a name="create-device"></a>

- Login to Azure CLI using `$ az login`
- Create a new device using `$ az iot hub device-identity create -n [IoTHub Name] -d [Device ID]`
- Get connection string for your device using `$ az iot hub device-identity show-connection-string -n [IoTHub Name] -d [Device ID]`
- Device connection string sample:

```
HostName=<azure-iot-hub-name>.azure-devices.net;DeviceId=<azure-iot-device-id>;SharedAccessKey=<base64-encoded-shared-access-key>
```

- This will be required in the examples



## Monitoring Results

<a name="monitoring"></a>

To see various events and the data being exchanged between the device and IoT hub from your command line, run the following command:

 `$ az iot hub monitor-events -n [IoTHub Name] --login '[Connection string - primary key]'`
 
 > Note the single quotes for the connection string. Without them, the command wont work as desired.
 
To monitor activity on your ESP device, run:

 `$ make monitor`

## Troubleshooting
<a name="troubleshooting"></a>

1. Some common problems can be fixed by disabling the firewall.

2. You can try with the followings, if your build fails:
	- `$ git submodule update --init --recursive`
	- Check the compiler version and verify that it is the correct one for your ESP IDF version.
	- Check if the IDF_PATH is set correctly
	- Clean the project with `make clean` and if required, using `rm -rf build sdkconfig sdkconfig.old`
	
3. Ensure that the device connection string received from Azure IoT Hub are correct.
